✅ **Fixed modal state management**: Added proper modal hiding and state reset
✅ **Added DOM element caching**: Improved performance by caching frequently used DOM elements
✅ **Enhanced form validation**: Added comprehensive validation with user feedback and focus management
✅ **Implemented safe localStorage operations**: Added error handling for localStorage operations
✅ **Added drag-and-drop functionality**: Properly implemented drag-and-drop for file upload areas

## Error Handling
✅ **Added try-catch blocks**: Wrapped critical functions in error handling
✅ **Improved time conversion**: Added validation and error handling for time conversion functions
✅ **Enhanced file handling**: Better error handling for file operations
✅ **Added user feedback**: Proper error messages and success notifications

## Performance Improvements
✅ **DOM element caching**: Reduced DOM queries by caching elements
✅ **Optimized event handlers**: Better event handling with proper error management

## Accessibility Improvements
✅ **Added ARIA attributes**: Improved accessibility for status chips and form elements
✅ **Enhanced keyboard navigation**: Added Enter key support for interactive elements
✅ **Added modal keyboard handling**: Escape key closes modals
✅ **Improved focus management**: Better focus handling in forms and modals

## Code Quality
✅ **Added input validation**: Trimmed inputs and validated required fields
✅ **Improved error logging**: Better console logging for debugging
✅ **Enhanced code organization**: Better separation of concerns

## Issues Still Requiring Attention

### Critical (Requires Backend Implementation)
❌ **File Upload**: Files are still not actually uploaded to server
❌ **Content Integration**: Content is only saved to localStorage, not integrated with actual HTML files
❌ **Authentication**: Still uses client-side authentication (security risk)

### Medium Priority
❌ **Data Persistence**: No server-side data storage
❌ **File Management**: No actual file management system
❌ **Session Management**: No proper session handling

### Low Priority
❌ **Testing**: No automated tests implemented
❌ **Modern Framework**: Could benefit from modern JavaScript framework
❌ **Progressive Enhancement**: Could add offline capabilities

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Immediate**: 
   - Implement proper server-side authentication
   - Add file upload API endpoint
   - Create content management API

2. **Short-term**: 
   - Add automated testing
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add loading states

3. **Long-term**: 
   - Consider framework migration
   - Add advanced features like bulk operations
   - Implement audit logging

## Notes
- The current fixes make the application more robust and user-friendly
- All critical client-side issues have been addressed
- The application is now ready for proper backend integration
- Security warnings are prominently displayed for developers
